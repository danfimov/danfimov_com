    <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      To be honest I could not share information about me on the Internet almost all my life.
      Because somewhere in my head I feel insecure about myself and don't really think that I can be interesting for someone.
      So creation of this site is kind of psychological exercise for me.

      Maybe it will be a nice example for someone who find this page in a corner of WWW
      and is feeling something similar now. <br><br>
      Thank you for your attention and have a nice day. Sending you hugs ðŸ’›
